# The journey begins.

## Introduction

I looked at how to make solutions more cost effective. I did this by watching Chad Smith's video "AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C02)" on https://learning.oreilly.com.

## Prerequisite

Before looking into cost effective solutions for databases, networks, storage, etc. I recommend that you know the name of the services and have a general idea of what they do. For instance, S3 infrequent access vs standard.

## Use Case

Creating and maintaining cost effective solutions is something that will be the focus for any business in the cloud. It will be good for your career if you have the ability to propose solid changes to management that will lower opex.

## Cloud Research

Right now I'm in the beginning stages of learning about the topic. I will post pictures and ideas as I progress in my learning.

## Try yourself

If you are already working in the cloud, maybe you have a DIY project or you work professionally in the cloud. I would encourage you to think outside the box and ask yourself, how can we do this differently, can we make changes that cut cost and would potentially increase our performance and availability?

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

I learned from watching Chad Smith that there are a lot of options that can work but that does not mean that all options are equally good. He has two questions at the end of each chapter and I did learn a lot from him going over those questions and explaining why we have a best answer amongst 2-3 correct answers.

## Next Steps

Next step is to read the AWS Well-Architected Framework.
