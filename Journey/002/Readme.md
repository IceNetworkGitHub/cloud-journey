# Day 2.

## Introduction

I looked at the AWS Well Architected Framework because it's going to help me prepare for the exam but it's also critical information to know and understand for my career.

## Prerequisite

I don't think you need to know much before studying the Well Architected Framework. There are multiple links in the document that you should click on and read so it will definatly lead you down many rabbit holes. :) 

## Use Case

The use case for this study is apparent at least to me. You will use this knowledge both to further your career and also to improve and maintain your cloud.

## Next Steps

I will continue to study the Well Architected Framework for day 3. I'm also going to start to look at https://www.exampro.co/. I really like Andrew Brown and his teaching style. I'll keep you posted on if I like the material or not. :)
